=================================================
Your CLI won't automatically pull your Git branch.
We have to find a file that will let you pull that information.
=================================================



In your CLI, enter:
	find / -name 'git-prompt.sh' -type f -print -quit 2>/dev/null


It should show you a path to where this file is located on your computer, such as:
	/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/share/git-core/git-prompt.sh


Copy that path, and in the top of your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file, enter:
	source /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/share/git-core/git-prompt.sh (or whatever path you got)


This tells the prompt where it can pull your Git branch information from.
